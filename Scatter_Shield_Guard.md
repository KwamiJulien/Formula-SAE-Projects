# Scatter Shield Guard
## Overview
The electric motor of the 2024-2025 Formula SAE vehicle required a scatter shield guard that acts as layer of protection in the case of radial failure. As such, I am designing a simple shield that would be attached to the motor using a L-bracket of my design.
## Drivetrain Module
The parts that I designed were the scatter shields around the motor and the sprockets as seen in the image below. Furthermore, to fasten the guard around the motor I designed a double L-bracket that bolts into the inside of the structural plate.

## Methodology
The entirety of the scatter shield guards as well as the bracket design was conducted using SOLIDWORKS software. 

## Future Work
This project is still ongoing and I plan to conduct research on fasteners to determine which would be optimal for the connection between the bracket and structural plate. I will also perform static and dynamic FEA to determine which areas need to be optimized. In addition, thorough material research will be conducted to determine which would be the most lightweight and heat resistant.

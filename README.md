# Formula-SAE-Projects
As a member of Queen's University's Formula SAE Racing team I have taken on modeling, FEA, and topology optimization tasks for the vehicle using SOLIDWORKS software.

Below is an overview of some of the projects I have completed and some that are still ongoing. To get more specific information on each of the projects simply follow the links.

[Sprocket_FEA_Topology_Optimization](./Sprocket_FEA_Topology_Optimization.md): One of the projects I completed for the Formula SAE team was the FEA and topology optimization (top op) of the rear sprocket of the drivetrain module. The goal of this optimization was to reduce the mass of the sprocket by 30% while maintaining a safety factor of at least 2.
